# The Evolution Story of the Streaming Giant Netflix: Adapting Profit Model in a Rapidly Changing Era

## 1. What have you done so far?

So far, we have established a specific thesis for the entire visualization, focusing on Netflix's transition from DVD rentals to streaming and the subsequent adaptations in their profit model. We then outlined the content for each page, detailing the necessary visualizations and interactive elements.

In terms of visualization, we have completed the Revenue line chart, the Revenue growth rate line chart, and the Content Asset line chart segmented by different types. Additionally, we developed a Global Map with a time bar to show Netflix's international expansion over time. For the interactive elements, we implemented tooltips on the line charts to provide detailed data points and added a time bar to the global map to allow users to explore Netflix's geographic expansion more informatively.

## 2. What will be the most challenging aspect of your project to design and why?

The most challenging aspect of our project will likely be coordinating the collaborative efforts efficiently and ensuring all team members are on the same page. Given the complexity and the amount of content required for the final project, we have to constantly update and refine our ideas, which can be inefficient. During our first meeting, we faced some difficulties in determining how to divide the work effectively.

We spent considerable time discussing the overall design of the web visualization. Each team member brainstormed and discussed the form of visualizations and interactive elements for each section together. This approach helps us synchronize our efforts and ensures that we are aligned in our understanding and objectives. Moreover, by dividing the project into larger modules, we can work simultaneously on different sections, avoiding any conflict over GitHub, and enhancing overall efficiency and coherence.
